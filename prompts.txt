

A web application that uses AI and computer vision to estimate the PSA rating of trading cards. The web application will:

Allow the user to upload images of collectable trading cards that will be portrait aligned and may contain a noisy background
Provide a score from 0, to 1 with 1 being perfect, for the straightness of all 4 edges and the sharpness of all for corners.
Provide a score from 0 to 1 with 1 being perfect, dictating the color and quality of the card face.
The PSA rating will include:

Use computer vision techniques to determination the straightness and consistency of all four card edges
Use computer vision and AI to assess the sharpness of all four corners
Use computer vision and AI to assess the cards centering and identify miscuts
Use computer vision and AI to assess any creases or defects on the card face
Use computer vision and AI to determine the quality of the cards color
Account for images that have noisy backgrounds, isolating the image and the image card boundaries



Project Information:
 - Project should be written in python


Edge Isolation:
 - Accepts an image file of a 2.5 inch by 3.5 inch trading card that is in portrait and aproximately centered in the scene.  
 - The trading card will have a white border. 
 - The background will contain some noise and shadowing.
 - Uses computer vision techniques to isolate the card in the image, and accurately determine the card edges
